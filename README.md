# Doodle Dice Monsters
Doodle Dice Monsters is a strategic turn-based battler where you can draw your own characters. It is a Chromium (with JavaScript/HTML/CSS) based video game, complete with a Node.js backend server hosted with Azure App Service, persistent cloud database integration with Azure CosmosDB and Blob Storage, and online multiplayer. I created the game without an engine for the purpose of learning web development and general programming, rather than use tools that would allow me to make shortcuts instead of learning properly. 

You can download the demo here, as the full game is not yet finished and released:

Given that Doodle Dice Monsters is a personal professional endeavor, I do not want to publically display the repo I use privately. However, without Doodle Dice Monsters, my GitHub looks very weak to recruiters and colleagues. Therefore, this page exists.
